```
U_i(n)  = reward function of current player i
        = vp difference of current player i and the opponent o
        = vp_i - vp_o

N_i(n)  = number of tries
C = constant (there is theoretical argument that C should be âˆš2)
PARENT(n) = parent of node n
```

## Our Code
```py
choices_weights = [
    (c.score / c.tries + c_param * np.sqrt(np.log(self.tries) / c.tries)) 
    for a, c in self.children
]
        
    return self.children[np.argmax(choices_weights)]
```

in this case,

```txt
U(n)    = c.score
N(n)    = c.tries
C       = c_param = 2 (default in textbook)
N(PARENT(n)) = self.tries
```

# Normal MCTS

UCBI calculations are correct. Chosen node: Sappers (BIRD) to RECRUIT is also correct.

# One-Depth MCTS
They use the same UCTI formula.
## Logs

Root
- <score, tries>
- (-145, 15)

Three child nodes:
- COMMANDER (-63, 5)
- DESPOT (-41, 5)
- BUILDER (-41, 5)

Chosen node: DESPOT (argmax chooses the first element that has max value)

## Calculation
**Commander**
```txt
U(n)    = -63
N(n)    = 5
C       = 2
N(PARENT(n)) = 15

UCBI    = -63 / 5 + 2 * sqrt(log(15) / 5)
        = -11.128
```
**DESPOT & BUILDER** (same params)
```txt
U(n)    = -41
N(n)    = 5
C       = 2
N(PARENT(n)) = 15

UCBI    = -41 / 5 + 2 * sqrt(log(15) / 5)
        = -6.728
```
UCBI calculations are correct. Chosen node: DESPOT is also correct.
# Conclusion
Our implementation of UCBI is correct.
